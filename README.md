Let's build a react giphy app!

Here is a [working version of the Giphy App](https://h6kdy.csb.app/)

#### Your task is:
* Go to the Giphy docs [HERE](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/), _read_ them,  create an account abd get your Free API key.

* Diagram your App:
  * What components will you have?
  * Where would state "live"?
  * Where do you need to pass props?

#### ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

* Minimum of 3 components.
* A diagram of your component hierarchy.
* No gifs will be fetched on intial page load
* An application that renders a button on page load.
* On Button click make an API call and retrieve/render a single random GIF
